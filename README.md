# Aquafy_Systems
Aquafy Solution is an innovative startup Project  dedicated to sustainable water management through advanced, decentralized water treatment technologies. Founded in 2024 and based in Bhubaneswar, the company aims to impact 600 million users in water-scarce areas with affordable, low-maintenance, and durable products. Its versatile systems treat greywater for reuse in homes, businesses, and industries, helping mitigate water scarcity. Aquafyâ€™s smart, automated solutions integrate IoT and AI, offering user-friendly designs that adapt to diverse needs. Recognized for its innovation, the company has earned awards like the Smart India Hackathon Runner-Up Award, highlighting its commitment to water sustainability.

## Problem Summary
Greywater management is very essential in a country like India, where there is widespread water stress among 600 million people. Current technologies are "expensive, land-consuming, and ill-suited for diffuse implementation. Most of the monitoring and maintenance for optimal performance are lacking in the existing wastewater treatment solutions and are operationally too expensive; they also poorly perform on water quality maintenance with manual intervention. Even the most space-saving compact treatment systems are difficult to afford even in small-scale applications and by individual houses in some cases. The use of water reclamation remains limited due to a lack of affordable solutions and is usually relied on fresh water for secondary purposes (non-potable uses). This challenge needs innovative, cost-effective, and scalable solutions, especially in resource-constrained environments.

## Solution
 Smart Gray Water Treatment Unit (AquafySystems)
Our cost-effective, reversible greywater purification system uses a multi-step process for efficiency and sustainability:
- Self-cleaning multi-test chamber: uses multiple screens up to 200 microns for particle removal, with a piston mechanism for automatic cleaning of clogged particles.
- Self-Cleaning Electrocoagulation Unit: Features GO-Nio doped electrodes with built-in self-cleaning mechanism for effective and durable treatment.
- Acoustic & Antifouling Ceramic Membrane: Provides good filtration with 1-micron pore size. The system emits leak-free sound waves, reducing maintenance and increasing water efficiency.
- Adsorption Filter: It uses GO doped Luffa biochar and agro-derived biochar for effective removal of organic pollutants through efficient adsorption.
- UV-C disinfection: UV-C bactericidal LED lighting ensures water safety.
- IoT Integration & ML Analysis: Our system uses IoT to monitor water quality in real time, tracking pH, TDS, turbidity, BOD and COD. It offers remote control via a mobile app, predictive maintenance, and self-service technology. ML analysis provides automated performance reporting and water quality monitoring, improving efficiency and ensuring effective, sustainable treatment.
    
These systems are designed to be versatile, efficient and cost-effective in decentralized water treatment systems.
